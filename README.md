### Github query project

We'll use this mini project to learn some things including

- Creating and updating github issues
- How to build a docker container and run a docker image
- Some linux CLI basics
- How to invoke the github API using an access token
- How to use `curl` to make HTTP requests on the command line
- Delivering code to git

Could also look at
- Using Postman instead of curl
- Using `jq` to transform JSON on the command line
- Maybe running a web server like flask or node

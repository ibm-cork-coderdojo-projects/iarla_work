#Note: - File name should not contain a space
#      - To query multiple repos, copy and paste this file, changing the variables below
#      - Seperate different label queries by spaces, if you want to query for an issue with multiple labels, seperate each label by a comma
#	   - Eg: defect = returns all issues with the defect label
#	     defect,Severity1 = returns all issues with both the defect and Severity1 lables
#	     defect Severity1 = returns all issues with the defect label, and all issues with the Severity1 label
#      - *** When using the Verified label with another (Eg: defect,Verified), make sure the Verified label is last (Verified,defect won't work)
